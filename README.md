# Sensory Memory Integration using Google CloudÂ Services
# The Flask Application:
Our journey began with Flask, a lightweight and flexible framework, perfect for our prototype. The application taps into the ConceptNet API, fetching and processing data based on user-provided keywords. This interaction forms the basis of our sensory memory system, where auditory cues are translated into meaningful connections.
